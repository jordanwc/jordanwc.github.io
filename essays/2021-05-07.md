Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. Here is an example PPT prototype

![Checkpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43251020/117532067-6d0ad300-af81-11eb-959d-f9641a14cb7a.png)

Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

My shopping cart will be quite simple, it is going to be a separate page where customers have to add items from the product page into the cart. The cart is going to have the items listed, the quantity and prices/fees almost like the invoice from assignment 2. If the customer wants to make changes they have to redirect back to the products page and add items into the cart. If they are not registered or logged in they have to login before checking out.

Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

I will use sessions to manage the quantity of the products stored in the shopping cart.

How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?

Currently, I have set to where users are not able to access the invoice without registering or logging in. I will avoid access to my application when the user has not logged in or registered by trying to use cookies attached to the user verifying if they are logged in or not. The particular security concerns I must address is that the user might be able to access the checkout without logging in.

Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)

Upon a successful login, I plan to have their personalized username on the top right and when successfully checked out it will thank the user.

If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?

I am not working with a partner, and will be doing this individually.

How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?

In Assignment 3, I am going to focus on one task at a time to make sure my code works before jumping to another task so I won’t get lost and I will ask for help earlier if needed rather than waiting last minute.
