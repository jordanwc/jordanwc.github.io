In the beginning of my academic career, I was a Computer Science major. I ended up not enjoying it and realizing that Computer Science was not for me, so I changed my major to MIS. 
The reason I switch to MIS was because I still wanted to pursue a career that had technology involvment. Technology use in our daily lives are becoming greater and greater
so having an MIS degree would be beneficial in creating many opportunites for my future career path. Also, I have a friend who graduated with an MIS degree and he recommended 
me to give it a try.
